Project Description:

Performed hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering on a dataset of news articles from Kos Daily, a political blog.
Classified articles into clusters based on their political affiliation in the 2004 US presidential election.
Analyzed the clusters and presented them using word clouds.
Skills Demonstrated:

Machine learning
Data analysis
Natural language processing
Visualization
Tools Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Results:

The clustering algorithms were able to successfully identify clusters of articles with similar political views.
The word clouds provided a visual representation of the topics discussed in each cluster.
The results of the project can be used to gain insights into the political landscape of the 2004 US presidential election.
